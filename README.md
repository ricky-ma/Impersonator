Creation of N-gram language models from given texts (i.e. published scientific papers, a person's tweets, Edgar Allan Poe poems) to analyze the frequency of words, word pairs, and longer word "grams". 
Using word-level Markov chain text generation, the program generates new text based on the likeliness of a word appearing after another. This will be done with the N-gram language models created from the given texts. If user input is given, the program will also return a completed sentence that "speaks" like the given data.
